<p>Welcome to the <strong>Goddard Sailing Association (GSA)</strong>. Founded in 1973, the association owns 3 boats: Solar Wind, a 19’ centerboard flying Scot; Sea Breeze, also a flying Scot; and a 27’ cabin cruiser named Take Luck. The flying scots are kept on a trailer and the cruiser in a slip at Selby Bay Sailing Center off the South River, south of Annapolis. Members may charter these boats at the lowest rates on the bay. The club also offers <a href="/clubs/sailing/sailing-classes/">class instruction</a> at several levels, opportunities to socialize and sail with other club members, and opportunities to race in the Scots.</p>

<p>In addition to classes, the club sponsors day-long sails to destinations such as Galesville, Annapolis, and the Eastern Shore. There are evening sails where both beginners and salty helmsmen enjoy a sunset on the bay and an occasional astronomy lesson a bit later. We have periodic (sometimes spontaneous) happy hours, lunches, and dinner parties.</p>

<p>All Goddard employees (civil servants and contractors, current or retired) and family members are welcome to <a href="#why-and-how-to-join">join GSA</a>. Please <a href="/clubs/sailing/sailing-contact/">contact us</a> if you have any questions.</p>

Excellent location for overnight anchorage (for example next to Big Island), with services available at nearby marinas. Highly recommended to stick to the marked channel, even in the Scots. From Turkey Point to Mayo Beach to Dutchman Point, the waters inshore of the channel are crowded with crab pots and shoals.

The entrance to the marina is 20+ feet wide, and there is plently of water for First Light’s 4ft draft.<br /><br />The restaurant is almost directly on the dockside. There are almost a dozen perpendicular slips specifically for diners to the east of the arrow, barely 10 feet from the front door. “2 hour free docking while dining” says the website. Several slips are available, but one can also point the bow out to the bay and make fast on the wharf at the green arrow in the image below.<br /><br />Dining: Casual dining both oudoor and indoor (air conditioning), good food ($12-20 for seafood entree), good staff, we’d go back, check out the specials. <a href="https://www.kentmorr.com/menu.php">Restaurant menu</a><br /><br /><!--[View of Kentmorr from above](IMAGES/MAPS/Kentmorr.jpg), --><a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&amp;ll=38.914636,-76.36417&amp;spn=0.003147,0.005316&amp;t=h&amp;z=18">Kentmorr in Google Maps</a></td>
